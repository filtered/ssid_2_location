Fixup to map SSID to locations in OSX

Install with make.

Passing SSID_MAP="work_ssid = Work Location" will initialize the config.
INSTALL_PATH may be changed, but should remain in the PATH - any changes not in path will require an explicit pathname definition in the plist file.
CONFIG_PATH may be changed, but the ssid_2_location executable must be updated to reflect such.  This may be corrected in future revisions.
GREP should be the location of grep and defaults to /usr/bin/grep.  This is currently irrelevant until the makefile begins using it.
